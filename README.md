## Overview
Arduino project with LED Matrix, 8 pixels high and 61 pixels wide, each with a built-in WS2812b controller chip.
Sound input with a ADMP401 microphone connected to the Teensy3.1 for fft frequency analysis using pcr

## Schematic

## Hardware
  8 x 61 LED matrix with WS2812b controller chip built in
 The LED matrix is mounted around a top hat. They are wired in a serpentine pattern:  
 row 2: ==>  76 77 78 . . . 111 112 113   
 row 1: <==  75 74 73 . . .  40  39  38   
 row 0: ==>   0  1  2 . . .  35  36  37   
 scrolling horizontally poses a programming problem in this configuration, because in rows 0 and 2 the index increases, but in row 1 the index decreases.

## Prerequisites
Uses FastLED for controlling the LEDs
