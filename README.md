##Overview
Arduino project with three LED Strips, each 38 pixels, each with a built-in WS2811 controller chip.
Sound input with a ADMP401 microphone connected to a MSGEQ7 equalizer chip for frequency analysis.

##Schematic

##Hardware
  3 x 5050 LED Strips with WS2811 controller chip built in
  The strips are mounted around a hat, because the strips are removable they are wired in an "S" form   
  row 2: ==>  76 77 78 . . . 111 112 113   
  row 1: <==  75 74 73 . . .  40  39  38   
  row 0: ==>   0  1  2 . . .  35  36  37   
  scrolling horizontally poses a problem in this configuration because in rows 0 and 2 the index increases, but in row 1 the index decreases.

##Prerequisites
Uses FastLED for controlling the LEDs
